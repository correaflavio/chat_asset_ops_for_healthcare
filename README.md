# chat_asset_ops_for_healthcare

Healthcare market, specially hospitals, are requesting asset management solutions using WiFi and BLE TAGs. Create a chatbot to run the asset management operations in an easy and realtime way, for the healthcare market integrating Webex Teams, Operational Insights and CMX location services.


## Business/Technical Challenge

Healthcare market is looking for better ways to manage and operate the multitude of assets that they have. Today the RTLS and asset management solutions rely on a graphical user interface for that and we believe that a chat based operation can provide better experience and more engagement for the different users.

## Proposed Solution

The solution proposed will integrate Cisco location engine solution (CMX), with Cisco asset management solution (Operational Insights) and Webex Teams. The objective is to create a chat bot where all the operations of the assets can be done and business rules from Op Insights can reach the right users at the right time. All of that in easy and realtime way.
